University group project- improvements upon original NHS website

<h3> About </h3>
<p> This website was a group project for one of the university modules. We came up with the idea of improving existing NHS not just to
have the information but also creation and tracking of the appointments. Since this was a group project I cannot claim to own and have not
developed all that could be seen in the source code, however I was heavily involved in the creation of the database as well as supporting the
development of multiple pages as well as helping to maintain the SQL database.</p>
